### ORGAN DROP-OFF POINTS & POTENTIAL FIXES

Along the organ recovery process there are several drop-off[^18] points where organs that had the potential to be transplanted are not.[^19] These drop-off points are sometimes due to clinical reasons, but more often than not, are because of ineffective practices, processes, communication, and technology.


## Drop-off Point #1: _When “Imminent death” referral is not made in a timely manner, or at all_


### Frequency/Size of Drop-off: **HIGH**[^20]

While the exact number has not been captured, researchers and OPO experts we spoke to estimate that there is a large number of referrals that are never made. A referral for a potential donor is a crucial step[^21] because it kicks off the whole organ recovery process.[^22] There is a significant opportunity for OPOs to work more effectively with donor hospitals and ensure all viable patients are referred. A missed referral means a missed approach, which means a missed opportunity to save up to eight lives (as every donor may have up to 8 transplantable organs). 


### **CAUSES**

### Lack of mandated standardization

While there are recommended clinical criteria for donation in the OPTN policies,[^23] OPOs ultimately have the discretion to define clinical triggers,[^24] as well as the terms “imminent death” and “timely referral” as part of their donor hospital agreements.[^25] This means that the clinical triggers do not have to be evidence-based and can be determined by a non-clinical person. Under current evaluation standards, OPOs are not incentivized to pursue every organ (more on this later). The resulting variations in clinical triggers make it harder for staff, such as travel nurses, who may move between hospitals to keep track of when to refer a potential donor.

### Poor training and working relationships with donor hospitals

In addition to varying clinical triggers, if OPOs do a poor job in educating hospital staff on organ donation and not maintaining a strong working relationship, hospital staff may be less likely to make timely referrals to OPOs. They may be busy/distracted or are not aware of the steps to refer. It is not only whether or not the hospital staff know the clinical triggers, but whether it is top of mind for them and whether they have the bandwidth to call it in, when they are focused on many other important tasks. 

We heard from an OPO leader that, _"Many OPOs have instructed hospitals to NOT call on [to refer] certain patients thus eliminating organ donors before they even get to the OPO."_ OPOs do this to tamper with the numbers they have to report as referrals in order to avoid documentation of cases where healthcare providers (HCPs) or the OPO anticipate that it will be an unlikely donation. Research has shown that implicit bias and preconceptions of who is likely to donate disproportionately affect minorities and people of color (see [Inequity in Organ Donation](({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/Inequity)). "Past studies comparing the experiences of African American (AA) and Caucasian families who have made decisions about donating a family member’s organs found that donor-eligible AA patients were less likely to be referred to an OPO by hospital staff."[^26]

OPOs are supposed to find these missed referrals in their death record reviews, but we heard, _“There’s no incentive to find those missed referrals. If they [the hospital] missed making a referral, they [the OPO] have to report it. There are incentives in the chain to cover up everybody else in the chain.”_ - _OPO COO._ One example of this, shared with us by a researcher, is that an OPO said they were getting 100% of referrals based on the OPO's death record audits, but when the OPO adopted an electronic automated referral system, the number of referrals went up. Because of this, an OPO leader emphasized that the referral potential for a donor hospital should not be assumed based on previous history of referral.


### **POTENTIAL FIXES**


### Standardize clinical triggers nationally

Clinical triggers for a donor referral should be evidence-based and determined by medical experts. A researcher told us that if they had access to better OPO data (that currently lives in OPO tech systems[^27] but never gets reported to the OPTN[^28]), they could determine what are the best clinical triggers based on historical data. This would clear the path for a set of nationally mandated clinical triggers that all OPOs and donor hospitals would use for referrals. 


### Leverage technology to make referrals less dependent on busy staff

Hospital staff are extremely busy and have multiple concurrent responsibilities. While it would still be important for OPOs to coordinate with hospital staff once onsite, making the initial referral less dependent on staff will lessen the chances for human error and alleviate the burden on hospital staff.



*   There are two tech systems currently being used to a very limited degree that attempt to do this. One version “pings” hospital staff when a patient meets clinical criteria, still requiring the nurse to call the OPO. The other is a fully-automated system that activates a referral to the OPO via a third party system, such as iTransplant.
*   These e-referral systems have shown increases in referrals[^29], but are slow to integrate and do not work with all hospital electronic medical record (EMR) systems. They are also currently only used as bespoke solutions between a single hospital and an OPO, which will only add further unnecessary complexity to the system if such technologies continue to be adopted ad hoc. 


*   A technical solution needs to happen at a national level rather than piecemeal.[^30] Having a national standard for clinical triggers will also make a national e-referral system simpler to implement. The ONC should set interoperability standards and requirements between OPOs, Donor Hospitals, and OPTNs in order to enable the introduction of new technologies into the organ donation space that currently is highly fragmented with a significant amount of information blocking put in place by incumbents.[^31] Having a standardized national system for automated referrals could also be useful for gathering data on average response time and help to evaluate OPOs on how well they are responding to referrals, which could inform potential OPO conditions for coverage requirements.


### Better education for donor hospital staff

More frequent and consistent donor hospital education is needed, not only for timely referrals but also for all the ways that OPOs and hospital staff need to coordinate. One OPO reported doing their hospital education annually, which is not nearly enough given the staff turnover and travel nurses who might be utilized. Donor hospital education is not standardized and varies greatly between OPOs.[^32] The hospital training may only be as good as how well the OPO staff are trained themselves, which is highly variable and non-standardized. When done by the Hospital Development Coordinator, who is non-clinical, trainings should be accompanied by a clinical OPO person, such as the clinical coordinator. In addition to advising on _when_ a potential donor should be referred, OPOs should also provide education on clinical donor management,[^33] so that donors do not expire and organs do not fail before OPO staff is able to follow-up on the referral. _“It [donor hospital training] is a hit or miss. OPO staff are also undertrained and under-knowledged...the content of the education could be improved.”_ _- OPO COO_

Donor hospital agreements set some expectations and protocols, but it is unclear who actually sees this agreement. We spoke with hospital frontline staff who said they were unaware of such an agreement and did not know what it contained. The expectations and agreements in these protocols should be a part of the donor hospital education by OPOs. As told to us by frontline staff,[^34] hospitals may need further protocols and agreements, such as what labs and procedures can be completed before a doctor declares brain death[^35] or before the next of kin has fully consented to donation. 


### Institute feedback loop

OPOs and donor hospitals working relationships often suffer.[^36] To identify — and, ideally, remediate — these issues before the damage becomes irreparable, there should be a standardized and regular feedback loop[^37] between OPOs and donor hospital staff who make referrals or were involved with a potential donor. This comes directly from an ICU nurse who told us, _"We need a feedback loop for performance. Right now they do their thing, we do our thing. There’s no meshing. No feedback."_ The first goal of this feedback loop is awareness – OPOs should have no excuses for being unaware of problems between OPO and hospital staff. The second goal is for these problems to be addressed effectively. To that end, this feedback data should be shared with CMS to ensure that actions are being taken. 

Currently donor hospitals and transplant centers[^38] can file a formal complaint to CMS to open up an investigation into an OPO.[^39] However, most hospitals do not file a complaint even when there are issues, because they do not think CMS will do anything about it. This is learned behavior, as CMS has never once successfully decertified an OPO for underperformance, in large part due to the lack of reliable metric data[^40] to enable enforcement of regulations.[^41] It is a lot of work for the hospital to file, with low expectations on return, which makes it an ineffective feedback mechanism. Some hospital staff we spoke to were not even aware that this mechanism existed. Similarly, donor hospitals and transplant centers can file a formal complaint to the OPTN, however such complaints are heard by the OPO subcommittee[^42] which is run by OPOs, presenting a clear conflict of interest.

Some OPOs may already be surveying their donor hospitals, but that information is kept internal and there is no meaningful pressure or accountability for the OPO to act on that information. CMS could tell OPOs that they need to survey hospitals (with standardized questions)[^43] and share that information back to CMS and the OPTN.

[^18]:
    Clinically, these drop-off points are referred to as either “organ loss” if the organ was never procured or “organ discard” if the organ was procured but never transplanted.

    Clinical triggers to refer include a  ventilated patient with a severe neurologic injury and one of the following: A patient whom a physician is evaluating for brain death, or a patient with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of five or less, or a plan to discuss withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies. There is a set of recommended clinical triggers, but OPOs ultimately determine the final triggers for each of their donor hospitals.

    An electronic referral should make it easy for an Intensive Care Unit clinician to click a single button in the electronic medical record when a patient is at end of life, to both notify the OPTN database directly and copy its local OPO that a potential donor should be evaluated by the OPO. It is important to stress the need for good user experience design to reduce, not add, burden on referral from the hospital staff. Electronic referral would have the added benefit of reducing time and transcription errors in organ procurement for the OPO. Staff from OPOs would also benefit from this feature, so they do not have to use tertiary systems, where manual data entry leads to the opportunity to lose or mistype data.
