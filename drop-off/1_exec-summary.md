## Executive Summary

Each year, more than 28,000 viable organs never get the opportunity to be transplanted to patients who desperately need them. And out of the organs that are obtained from deceased donors, about a fifth of kidneys and pancreases are never transplanted. Central to this problem is the extreme performance variability and lack of basic accountability of Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) who are responsible for obtaining transplantable organs within their regions across the U.S. Communities of color are disproportionately harmed by system failures. Despite very clear issues, no OPO has ever lost its certification status for poor performance, which is costing lives and taxpayer dollars. Yet there is new commitment from the federal government to address and correct solvable problems in the system. This document offers strategic and actionable insights to build on this momentum and improve organ recovery outcomes in the short and long term.    

The 58 OPOs across the country are tasked with managing and coordinating an organ recovery process that broadly consists of three phases:



*   **Phase 1: Procurement** - Coordinating with donor hospitals to procure organs from deceased donor patients who meet clinical criteria for donation. 
*   **Phase 2: Match & Recovery** - Matching the procured organ(s) with a patient on the waiting list to receive that organ, and overseeing surgical recovery of the organ(s). 
*   **Phase 3: Transport & Transplant** - Transporting the recovered organ to the transplant center in sufficient time so that it can be transplanted successfully. 

We identified many issues specific to OPO practices that impede organ recovery efforts at every phase of the process, including: 



*   Unmade referrals of a potential donor 
*   OPOs not responding to a donor referral in time for the organ to be used successfully
*   OPOs failing to obtain family authorization 
*   OPOs not being able to find a suitable recipient while the organ is still transplantable
*   OPOs not safely transporting an organ to its destination in sufficient time

There are some clinical reasons that cause these drop off points and others. But unfortunately,  there are far too many that are attributable to ineffective OPO practices, processes, communication, and technology.

There are significant harms — the donor's decision to donate may not be honored, the family may not get closure or comfort, patients on the waiting list die, and costs increase to the national health care system. And yet OPOs are able to keep these harms invisible."

Many of these challenges have root causes that we believe can be addressed. In particular, there are critical opportunities related to: 



*   **Accountability** - Holding OPOs (who are government contractors) to more rigorous standards around organ recovery, transportation and logistics, and urgency around donor matching.
*   **Staffing & Training** - Addressing understaffing and poor training to improve coordination and communication among key stakeholders in the system.
*   **Data & Technology** - Improving data and technology throughout the process so that it can be leveraged more efficiently to support organ recovery. 

_A more detailed list of recommended actions can be found towards the end of the document._

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has a critical window of opportunity to fix the organ transplant system, as catalyzed by the Executive Order on Advancing American Kidney Health that seeks to improve patient access to organ transplants, and a proposed rule change that holds OPOs accountable. These changes — once finalized and implemented — have the power to recover thousands of life-saving organs and save billions of taxpayer dollars.

# INTRODUCTION

Problem: Currently, 58 Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) are designated across the US. They are each responsible for obtaining transplantable organs within their own territory of hospitals in their donation service area (DSA), without competition from any other organizations, which essentially renders each OPO as a monopoly for organ procurement for their DSA.[^1] Without strong performance guardrails, performance of OPOs across the nation has been variable — by as much as 470% in organ recovery.[^2] Despite this, no OPO has ever lost its government contract for poor performance. Research has shown that 28,000[^3] organs each year go unrecovered by OPOs and a December 2019 Notice of Public Rulemaking from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) flagged a majority of the nation’s OPOs as failing basic proposed outcome metrics.[^4] 

Opportunity: With the proposed rule change on outcome measures,[^5] OPOs may be further motivated to improve their practices in order to avoid decertification. Potential competitive pressures from higher performing OPOs could help motivate OPOs to increase organ procurement and placement. Given the recent Executive Order on Advancing American Kidney Health,[^6] Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) may also decide in the future to further refine other conditions of coverage to call for the adoption of practices that increase organ recovery and transplantation. 

Discovery Sprint**:** Based on interviews with OPO, donor hospital, and transplant center staff, as well as researchers and other leaders[^7] in the organ transplant system, this report offers insight into the issues impeding organ recovery and the practices that could address these issues. Given that there have been limited studies that examine the effects of specific OPO practices, the findings in this report are reinforced with data when possible, though are largely case studies.

As mentioned above, OPOs have the responsibility of procuring organs from deceased patients and placing them with transplant centers. To carry out this responsibility, OPO staff must coordinate with donor hospitals[^8] to procure organs from deceased donor patients who meet clinical criteria, and with transplant centers[^9] to match those organs with recipients on the organ waiting list. 

### Phase 1: Procurement


1. Hospitals notify OPOs of “imminent deaths” based on clinical triggers. It is then the responsibility of the OPO to assess that patient’s donation potential.
2. If the OPO decides this is an eligible donor, they will start to follow the case — ideally having an integrated plan of action with the donor hospital staff.[^10] 


3. Once brain death protocol is started, or in the case of donation after circulatory death (DCD),[^11] that the family has begun discussing withdrawal of care,[^12] the OPO will talk with the next of kin about organ donation — either to notify them if the patient was a registered donor, or to ask for organ donation authorization if the patient was not registered. 


4. If donation is authorized, the OPO and hospital staff will do testing to gather more data and ensure the organs are viable and safe to transplant.

### Phase 2: Match & Recovery



1. Once the organs are deemed transplantable, the OPO enters the donor’s clinical data into the organ offer technology to run a “match list.” This provides the OPO with an ordered list of the patients in line to receive that organ. 
2. OPOs must work quickly to run down the match list to find an accepting transplant center and recipient.[^13]
3. The surgical recovery of the organs is scheduled and usually takes place at the donor hospital.[^14] For some organs, surgeons from the transplant centers will travel to the donor hospital to perform the surgical removal of the organs and take the organs back with them. For other organs, local surgeons will perform the surgery[^15] and the organs must be shipped to the transplant center.  
Phase 3: Transport & Transplant



1. Once organs are surgically removed, the OPO prepares them for transit, and arranges transportation.[^16] The transportation of the organ to the transplant center is time-sensitive since the organ degrades with increased cold-ischemia time (time outside the body).[^17]
2. Once the transplant center has the organ, surgeons transplant it into the recipient candidate.

     Government officials have noted that because of this given monopoly and lack of market pressure, OPOs should be held to stricter standards and more transparency.

    "For potential brain dead donors, the data indicates that best practices are to introduce the possibility of brain death as early as possible, specifically once the injury or the condition indicates it is not survivable. This is likely when the brain death protocol is started or when the family or health care providers begin discussing withdrawal of mechanical supports. For patients who are potentially eligible for DCD, it is when the family initiates a discussion of withdrawal of supports." - Researcher
