## Drop-off Point #5: _When OPO does not place an organ while it is still viable_


### Frequency/Size of Drop-off: **MEDIUM**

OPOs use the UNOS organ offer technology to generate a match list between the organ and recipient candidates on the waitlist. OPOs are responsible for going down this list to manage organs offers[^113] until the offer is accepted. Ideally every organ from a donor would have an accepted match before it is surgically removed, but that is often not the case.[^114] When that happens, OPOs are running against the clock because of how long the organ is outside the body. As one OPO leader told us, _"Organ placement can take forever – many times it is the commitment of the coordinator doing the allocation that drives whether the organ gets placed. Many OPOs ‘try’ locally/regionally – going through the list but if it ‘gets too hard’ they give up and the organ is lost."_

How often this happens varies depending on organ type and OPO practices. As reported to the OPTN in 2018, 19% of kidneys, 21% of pancreases, 8% of livers, 3% of intestines, 1% of hearts, and 7% of lungs were recovered for transplant but not transplanted.[^115] OPO experts we spoke to said they believe not placing the organ in time is the largest point of organ discard for the remaining drop off points.[^116] 


### Causes


### Bad organ offer technology

DonorNet interface is difficult to use and presents information in a way that can discourage organ acceptance by disregarding behavioral biases and placing a large cognitive burden on transplant surgeons.[^117] As a result 84% of all kidney offers are declined by transplant centers on first offer because of organ or donor quality concerns, patient-related factors, logistical limitations, or other concerns.[^118] Additionally, the waitlist is not updated properly, resulting in 17% of transplanted kidneys getting offered to at least 1 deceased patient.[^119] This is not only bad technology practice, but it also wastes time and contributes to discards[^120]. A researcher has framed this as, _"The offer has never made it to a patient who CAN accept it. What tends to happen is that sick people get offers for organs that they can't tolerate because they're too sick already. They'll have too many complications. There IS a patient for that organ, but an offer never makes it to a patient who can accept the organ."_ 


### Ineffective use of time working through the match list

Several decision loops occur during the placement process. After doing the match run to get a match list, an OPO can notify up to 3 transplant programs (for an unlimited number of corresponding waitlist recipient candidates) on the list that there is a potential match. For each recipient candidate, transplant centers have an hour to acknowledge the provisional offer, then an hour to evaluate the offer and put in their provisional yes or refusal code. We have heard that transplant centers will often say yes to the provisional offer, even if they have not fully evaluated the offer and use this as a way to “hold” their place in line. This provisional offer is meant to save time by removing recipients who are not interested, but because it is not used properly, it wastes time when the primary offer comes around because only then will some transplant centers start the evaluation process. 

The primary offer is given to one recipient on the list at a time, and transplant centers have one hour to respond. The offer does not automatically close after an hour, however, so transplant centers may take more than the allotted hour to respond, which eats up time and contributes to discards if they ultimately refuse the organ. 

Additionally, transplant centers may ask for more tests to be done before responding to an offer. While OPTN policy does list some labs that must occur before offers are made, because of the wide range of potential donor conditions, there are some tests that are not mandated, yet are often still needed by transplant centers to make an offer decision, such as a cardiac catheterization or chest computed tomography (CT) scan. Some OPOs are less proactive about performing these tests before the match run as a perceived cost saving measure, which can waste valuable time. 


### UNOS Organ Center inadequacies 

UNOS Organ Center is responsible for kidneys that need to be placed nationally, and pancreata that need to be placed regionally or nationally. We heard from multiple people in the OPO industry about how slow, inefficient, and unaccountable the UNOS Organ Center can be. 

One former OPO coordinator told us, _"When I was placing organs, I would have 3 phone calls out at once, not wasting a minute...The UNOS [Organ Center] people don't have that urgency. They sit at their desk, they make their call, they go to the next one. They don't have 5 calls out, they don't call ahead to an aggressive transplant center...The good OPOs, they are on it, they don't waste a minute and they'll do some of UNOS' work for them. UNOS [Organ Center] people are non-clinical people with no emotional tie to the case."_

Another OPO expert highlighted, _“The UNOS Organ Center is so bad at this [placing organs]. I'm fighting with them on the phone, tell them you made a mistake, call the transplant center back, while I have a doctor yelling in my other ear. It is horrendous. **There is no external check on the quality of UNOS' own internal allocation system**…Any miscommunication or loss of communication can add enough cold-ischemic time [for the organ to become non-viable]. **We have no visibility into how often this happens because only UNOS can report that to UNOS**.”_


### Potential Fixes


### Better organ offer technology

The following changes in the organ offer technology could help increase transplant center acceptance:



*   Provide assisted clinical decision making[^121] [^122] by showing users the probability of how long it might take for their patient to get a better organ offer,[^123] or the value of this accepting the kidney over their patient staying on dialysis. 


*   Stop showing how many other transplant centers have rejected the offer in order to mitigate for risk-aversion. 
*   Automatically sync data between the waitlist, death registry, and other sources for death data to ensure offers are not made to deceased patients. 
*   Update the provisional and primary offer notification system to modern standards[^124] to ensure transplant centers can see the most pertinent information as soon as possible. 
These are functions that can be built into the “OPTN Tech Stack” as part of the Organ Transplant Technology Ecosystem _(link to tech doc)_. 


### More comprehensive testing done earlier

OPOs should be proactive in getting all reasonable tests done to discover any major issues before offers are made. To avoid time wasted on the back and forth, standards for which donor patient criteria should mandate which tests should be set by a nationally respected, third party entity. One OPO CEO said he believed that OPOs should take the approach of, “_Let's proactively get all these tests done and put all the info out there, then make our offers.”_


### Virtual crossmatching

A reliance by some OPOs on physical (rather than virtual) crossmatching means that an OPO will sometimes draw several vials of blood from a donor in front of their family before the family has even authorized donation. Moving to virtual crossmatching[^125] means that one vial of blood can be drawn after donor authorization with the family, and that blood can be virtually matched with all patients on the waitlist, which greatly increases the transplant center’s ability to quickly accept an organ offer.[^126] 


### More persistent matching/placement

As one OPO leader told us, _“Our philosophy has always been that there is a home for every organ…and we HAVE to place EVERY organ. Not all OPOs share this philosophy.”_ This is an approach that all OPOs should have for every case. In order to do this, OPOs need to get to know and establish good relationships with all their transplant centers, so that they are aware of who is more likely to accept what types of organs. One leading OPO said, “We sent an Advanced Practice Registered Nurse to every transplant center in our new allocation area,” which speaks to the persistence and resources some OPOs will put into establishing relationships with their transplant centers. 

Since the organ offer match run technology is inefficient, OPOs with high placement metrics have surgeons available they can call to expedite an organ at risk of discard. Additionally, the UNOS Organ Center should be held accountable for their organ placement by a third-party that is not the OPTN, since UNOS runs the OPTN. Their metrics and outcome performance data should be made publicly available along with all other OPOs’ data.

_“You are effectively incentivized to discard [the organ] or not pursue. Working hard to place the organ with a transplant center that will take it is not rewarded. The frustrating thing is you can spend hours justifying expedited placement, whereas just walking away is not questioned.” - OPO CEO_

## Notes

[^113]:
    For kidneys and pancreases, OPOs are responsible for local and regional matches, for national matches it goes to the UNOS Organ Center. 

[^114]:
    A donor could provide up to 8 organs that need to be matched to potentially 8 different recipients at 8 different transplant centers. This can become a massive coordination effort in both timing and geography.

[^126]:
    To aid in virtual crossmatching, transplant centers need to also keep results of their patients ready for virtual crossmatching. One OPO aids this effort by keeping virtual crossmatch results for all patients in their local coverage area. The system of virtual crossmatching should ideally be integrated into the organ matching technology so that a donor and candidates labs can be shown compared at the time of offer.
