## Drop-off Point #7: _When an OPO fails to transport an organ to its destination in a timely manner, or if on arrival the organ is unsuitable for the intended recipient_


### Frequency/Size of Drop-off: **LOW**

Analysis by Kaiser Health News (KHN) and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting found that, even from the small subset of kidneys placed by the UNOS Organ Center, “between 2014 and 2019, nearly 170 organs could not be transplanted and almost 370 endured ‘near misses,’ with delays of two hours or more, after transportation problems.”[^130] For organs handled by the UNOS Organ Center, KHN reported 7% of those shipments encountered transportation problems - meaning this failure happens several times each month. One OPO coordinator we spoke to estimated this drop-off point to be about 10%. We don't know how often organ damage from transportation issues occurs across all OPOs because of lack of transparent data, but it should be a never-event and can be mitigated.

_"The real issue, in a time when we can track our tube of toothpaste from Amazon in real-time, is where organs are. Giving the organ to an unreliable courier at 2:30am and feeling confident that it's going to be safe, protected, and taken directly to the destination…that’s the real issue." - OPO COO_


### **CAUSES**


### Lack of standardization, communication, and data

There are mandates on labeling, packaging, and who witnesses necessary signatures, but there is complete discretion for what methods OPOs can use to transport organs. Thus, every OPO manages transportation of organs differently and ad hoc. As one logistics expert framed it, _"It's people on the fly, making their own determinations, they’re not making decisions based on data."_ Because everyone is doing things differently, there’s no central source of data to analyze what are the best routing and transportation practices. 

Antiquated tracking systems are being used, as KHN reports, "Surgeons themselves often go to hospitals to collect and transport hearts, which survive only four to six hours out of the body. But kidneys and pancreases — which have longer shelf lives — often travel commercial, as cargo. As such, they can end up missing connecting flights or being delayed like lost luggage. Worse still, they are typically tracked with a primitive system of phone calls and paper manifests, with no GPS[^131] or other electronic tracking required.[^132] 

The condition of the organ is not monitored during transport, which can also contribute to discard if its condition becomes less transplantable. Poor communication between the local recovery/procurement surgeon and transplant surgeon, as facilitated by the OPO, may also result in the transplant surgeon having different expectations of the organ and rejecting it when it arrives because of the differing condition. 


### Poor logistics and routing 

_"Logistics is not a core competency of OPOs, even though one of their core responsibilities is getting organs to transplant centers,"_ a logistics expert told us. This is evident in the inconsistent quality of transportation reported (e.g. organ box arrived with tire marks[^133]). There are multiple handoffs, which when handled ineffectively, result in wasted time. 

Cold-ischemic time (CIT) is a major issue in organ transport. Research has indicated that “each additional hour of travel may shorten the life the organ can provide to the transplanted patient.”[^134] A study found that “each additional hour of CIT was associated with a significant 1.3% increased risk of graft failure and 1.8% increased risk of death.”[^135]<sup> </sup>Therefore OPOs should be doing everything possible to reduce cold time. Oftentimes, OPOs will default to booking a flight, when having the organ driven to its destination would be faster and more efficient than waiting for the next available flight[^136]. As a former OPO coordinator noted, _“There’s going down a checklist - and there’s critical thinking to reduce cold time.”_


### **POTENTIAL FIXES**


### Capture data to improve routing and transparency

One of the conditions of coverage that OPOs must uphold in order to stay certified is to transport organs in a manner that "ensures their arrival without compromise to the quality of the organ."[^137] CMS should hold OPOs accountable for every organ shipment under their purview — including recently documented failures.[^138] UNOS needs to be held accountable likewise for organ transport failures handled by the UNOS Organ Center. Additionally, OPOs should capture and make available the data on transport method, time, cost, and organ condition for each organ shipment in order to make route and transport method optimizations. Tracking organ vitals and transport conditions (such as temperature and vibrations) can provide data on how travel conditions affect organ condition. Once enough data has been gathered and shared, CMS can implement standardized regulations on what is acceptable for transport. 


### Utilize modern technology and better communication

“Modern logistics is almost entirely now a technological problem which has been solved by numerous industries,” notes our team’s technologist, “Particularly in the area of transportation, there is high interest and private funding focused on improving the logistical challenge of transporting organs.”[^139] HHS could tap these logistics industry experts by creating a federal contract for organ logistics and separate out all of the OPTN’s current transportation responsibilities. . Additionally, all OPOs should utilize organ life-extending technology currently used by some OPO peers, such as TransMedic[^140] and shipping kidneys on a pump to keep organs in optimal condition.

In terms of communication between surgeons, it should always be a practice for OPOs, when possible, to have a conference call between the procuring surgeon and transplant surgeon before any organ recoveries to ensure everyone is on the same page on expectation.
