## OPO Performance Ratings Based on Final Rule

On March 30th, 2021, the Biden-Harris Administration officially finalized a life-saving [rule](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/112020-opo-final-rule-cms-3380-f.pdf) from November to revise outcome measures for Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs), the 57 government contractors tasked with coordinating organ donation. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) projects that minimum compliance with the rule will save[ 7,000 lives per year](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/112020-opo-final-rule-cms-3380-f.pdf); additionally, projections show that Medicare will save [$1 billion per year](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-03-24/biden-should-implement-trump-s-organ-donation-policy-fix) in foregone dialysis costs for those transplanted. [COVID-19 ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/03/severe-covid-19-can-lead-to-kidney-failure-medical-studies-reveal.html)has made these reforms even more urgent, as studies show the virus damages kidneys. [Bipartisan congressional leaders](https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/031621%20Bipartisan%20Bicameral%20HHS%20OPO%20Rule%20Support%20Letter.pdf) have highlighted OPO reform as a critical health [equity issue](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20201211.229975/full/), as current system failures disproportionately harm [patients of color](https://bloomworks.digital/organdonationreform/Inequity/). The rule takes effect for the 2022 recertification cycle, and will be updated by HHS as new data becomes available.

The following map and table show how OPOs across the country were categorized in terms of performance in the final rule, based on data from 2018.

- Tier 1 <span class="passing">(gray)</span> indicates passing;
- Tier 2 <span class="underperforming">(yellow)</span> indicates underperforming, with the designated service area (DSA) open for competition from higher performing OPOs;
- Tier 3 <span class="failing">(red)</span> indicates failing, leading to the DSA going to a higher performing OPO.

The table also includes the number of patients waiting for organs in each state served by the OPO.
