# Introduction

If the U.S. fixed its broken organ donation system, it could save thousands of lives and $40 billion in taxpayer money over the next decade.

Despite scientific advancements, the organ donation system is held back by poor management and performance.

Bloom Works investigated and analyzed the current organ donation system through interviews, case studies, and existing research. These reports outline what we found, and what recommendations we have for improving the system.
