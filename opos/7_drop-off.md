## Drop-off Point #6: _When OPO fails to recover organs in a timely manner or an organ is found to be non-viable after recovery_


### Frequency/Size of Drop-off: **LOW**

Between when an organ offer is accepted and when the organ is transplanted into a recipient candidate, there are still potential failure points that could result in the organ not being transplanted. While these drop-off points do not occur frequently, they could often be avoided altogether.


### Causes


### Failure to secure OR and surgeon in time

OPOs may have difficulty securing an operating room and/or surgeon, so it takes them a long time to get in to recover the organs. This could come up against (real or perceived) family time constraints, especially for DCD deaths. A Washington Post investigation reported that a potential donor’s mother "said she was ‘devastated’ when the OPO told her they couldn’t find a match for her daughter’s organs. She was stunned to learn later about the dispute over a surgeon...“If they needed more time to find one, we would have agreed to give them more time. They didn’t ask.”[^127] Donor families are sometimes given unrealistic expectations by the OPO coordinator of how long the process might take and start to get anxious about wanting the process to draw to a close. 


### Mistrust for remote recovery 

The recovery[^128] of the organs from a donor needs to be sequenced and may need to accommodate several different surgeons in one operating room.[^129] Currently, transplant center surgeons will often fly in to personally recover the organ that they will be transplanting. There is a lack of trust for the local team to do the recovery, less so because of surgical error, but because of the decision making that is needed to make the final determination of whether the organ is transplantable. Once the organ is surgically removed from the body, it can reveal certain information that cannot be determined by labs beforehand. 


### Potential Fixes


### Hospital agreements and setting family expectations

As discussed in earlier drop off points, OPOs need to establish good working relationships with their donor hospitals and transplant centers, which can help facilitate easier access to operating room times and surgeons. OPOs could even set up operating room time and surgeon agreements into their contracts if this issue persists. OPO coordinators need to set more realistic expectations with donor families about the variability of how long the matching and recovery might take (e.g. that it may take 3 days, rather than one day). 


### Local recovery teams

Some OPOs have their own recovery teams — trained surgeons or other certified clinicians who are on staff. Other OPOs rely on their local transplant surgeons to do the recovery. Surgeons who do not recover their own organs often ask who is doing the recovery, and OPOs should have back-up surgeons available whenever possible in case the accepting team is not available.

Certain technology like Google Glass can give transplant surgeons good visuals into the organ so that they can make their own call on whether it’s transplantable, regardless of whether they were the ones doing the recovery. Imaging is an important aspect of the decision making. As one OPO coordinator told us, _"COVID is forcing them [transplant surgeons] to trust other procurement surgeons,"_ which could open up possibilities for this to become normalized in the future.

Sometimes the term “procurement” is used interchangeably to mean surgical removal of organs. We will be using the term “recovery” in this paper to avoid confusion with our use of the term “procuring” to mean securing and getting authorization for donation.
