## Drop-off Point #4: _When OPO finds after testing that organ is not viable_


### Frequency/Size of Drop-off: **LOW**

Researchers and OPO staff we talked to estimated that this is a low drop-off point[^109] relative to other drop-off points. The important note here is that there is a lot of discretion afforded to OPOs at this point, which is problematic in the broader context of a lack of transparency, accountability, or regulatory pressure to improve. OPOs can each have their own definition of viability (suitability and transplantability) when they start this testing. 


### Causes


### Primarily clinical reasons

Organs can be deemed non-viable for a number of clinical reasons. One interviewee provided an example of how this can look:, _"We had one of those last week, the patient was going into multi-organ system failure, secondary to septic shock. We took a run at the case to see if we could turn anything around using current practices. We spent 24 hours managing, I ended up going onsite the next day … but the patient's liver was still failing… unfortunately it didn't become realistic to continue moving forward."_


### Poor clinical donor management

Sometimes the condition of the organ is related to clinical donor management.[^110] Transition of care for deceased donor management can be messy and confusing if the OPO and hospital staff do not have a clear protocol. Previous research has stated, “a collaborative effort between the nurse and the procurement coordinator will help maintain the stability of the donor’s condition and contribute to timely completion of diagnostic studies.”[^111]


### Potential Fixes


### Measures to make organs more transplantable

There are measures that can be taken to make an organ more suitable for transplantation, but not all OPOs carry out these efforts consistently. For example, an organ can be perfused to improve functionality to take a non-transplantable organ and make it transplantable. “_Donor management needs to be standardized and outcomes evaluated. Most OPOs do not participate in the donor management goals workgroup.[^112] Most OPOs blow it off.” - OPO CEO._


### Clinical donor management training

In addition to education for hospital staff, key OPO roles such as the medical directors and administrators on call should undergo standardized deceased donor management training. As we heard from a former OPO coordinator, _“Medical directors don’t have training on donor management. They sometimes treat them like they’re a live patient. It is totally different.”_
