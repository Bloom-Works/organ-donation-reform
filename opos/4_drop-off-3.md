## Drop-off Point #3: _When OPO does not obtain family authorization_


### Frequency/Size of Drop-off: **MEDIUM**

Family authorization rates can vary widely from OPO to OPO, with even the national authorization rate average ranging based on different analysis and sources. A 2015 study of 2008-2013 data found authorization rates ranging from 63.5% to 89.5%[^75] while other studies estimated between 65%[^76] to 75%[^77] on average nationwide. Accuracy of these authorization rates is questionable, however, because OPOs self-report their rates. As an OPO CEO noted, _"If an OPO is reporting a 90% authorization rate, I would be worried about how often they are actually approaching."_

Regardless, this is one of the most fixable drop-off points because 80% of families report that they would have donated if they had been approached correctly.[^78] When we have seen OPOs dramatically improve their organ transplant rate with new leadership, the new leadership’s focus always included improving family authorization rates.  


### Causes


### Poor timing/poor interaction

Problematic OPO approaches to family, such as approaching at the wrong time or having a poor quality of interaction may lead to families declining authorization.[^79] The likelihood of wrong time and poor interaction is exacerbated if OPO staff is not coordinating with hospital staff. Studies have shown that “initial receptivity to organ donation may reflect the family’s experience with the hospital healthcare team prior to the donation request...These results reveal the association between the donation decision and the coordination between HCPs and OPO staff.”[^80]

Best practices for approaching families as documented in several sources[^81] are not always followed. For example, the OPO coordinator may not come in-person, may not be sensitive to cultural or religious issues, may not educate family about misconceptions, may not cover critical topics in their discussion with the family, or may not spend adequate time with the family. “Previous studies found] that when referred, African American (AA) families report less complete discussions about the possibility of organ donation and are often not told of the need for transplantable organs within the AA community.”[^82]Additionally, because it is an overwhelming time for many families, some may need to be approached multiple times, thus some coordinators may give up too early on obtaining authorization. 


### Poor training and support for requestors

Currently there is no central source of truth or training for coordinators requesting authorization from a donor’s next of kin. We have heard of only one masters program in the country (at University of Toledo[^83]) that provides accredited training on how to become an organ donation coordinator.[^84] There are smaller programs from different OPOs[^85] and associations, and a certificate[^86] that is not required to be hired as a coordinator. One OPO leader told us, _“There's no real specialized training. There's one Masters program in Toledo. So, they self-train...right now [OPO coordinator training] is disjointed, it's sporadic. There’s no good training program in the country that I would endorse."_ While a former OPO coordinator said, _"Training keeps getting worse and worse...there's no standard training, it's very subjective. There's the CPTC [certification program]_[^87] _but you don't even need to do it to be a coordinator. They're setting people [OPO staff] free before they're really ready."_ Other studies have also spoken to this need, "Standardized training for organ donation request staff is needed to ensure the highest quality communication during requests, optimize rates of family authorization to donation in all regions, and increase the supply of organs available for transplantation.”[^88]


### Poor coordination with hospital staff

When OPO staff does not coordinate with hospital staff, it can be detrimental to family authorization rates and to the long term working relationship between the OPO and the hospital. One study reported that “the majority of HCPs continue to view OPO staff as outsiders rather than part of the healthcare team. A multidisciplinary request protocol involving both HCPs and OPO staff in family donation conversations has proven effective in increasing rates of organ donation.”[^89]

When the coordination does not happen, OPOs remain as “outsiders” and can adversely affect the end of life care planning that the hospital staff already has in play, resulting in a poor interaction with the donor family. We heard from hospital staff, _"We have a terrible relationship with the OPO - they don't come in until the end... Steamrolling in talking to the family when they think it’s the right time. Often it’s after we’ve already set up a game plan...they jump in and take over...we don't even know who they are."_ This has further ramifications, as we heard from one donor hospital physician, _“A lot of my coworkers are not donors because of how terrible the process is at our hospital...the Palliative Care Director is not a donor because of the number of times [the OPO] really ruined end of life care.”_ 


### Not utilizing data

Lack of benchmarking data can lead to lack of motivation to improve, because OPO staff could be unaware of how they compare to other OPOs, including being unaware that they may have significant room to improve. One OPO leader who increased organ recovery at their OPO by nearly 30% in their first year as CEO used data to benchmark where their OPO was and shared with their staff that they were in the fourth quartile for authorization and conversion of donors. The staff at that OPO said they did not know they were that bad. There needed to be awareness of the problem before it could be addressed. Similarly, when data are not used to understand the demographics of an OPO’s DSA, it is a missed opportunity for the OPO to staff and train coordinators better to approach donor families of those demographics. 


### Potential Fixes


### Better training for requestors

There needs to be standardized training of OPO coordinators on best practices for approaching donor families for authorization.[^90] [^91] Research indicates that the factor most likely to predict whether a family will donate is whether the OPO coordinator showed sensitivity and compassion to the family and did not pressure them to donate.[^92] Research also shows the critical need for initial training for staff involved in these conversations, even as there are no national standards that mandate these trainings.[^93] Such training could focus on already-established best approach practices, including:



*   Separating requests for organ donation from declaration of death[^94]
*   Effectively communicating[^95] [^96] with the family - including initiating the request in an empathic manner, acknowledging the loss of the patient, covering key topics,[^97] developing a supportive trust-based relationship, and providing closure to the family.  
*   Timing is also crucial to making effective requests. When families perceive that the request was made at the appropriate time, they are more likely to consent.

In addition to best approach practices, requestors should undergo explicit and implicit bias training, as research has shown that implicit bias is a factor in donor family approaches. “There is also evidence of implicit bias, i.e., the extra-conscious beliefs or attitudes toward individuals by virtue of some ‘irrelevant characteristic,’ that permeate discussions of organ donation with African American families about the opportunity for donation while in hospital.”[^98]<sup> </sup>[^99]


### Spend more time with donor families

A clear strategy to increase family authorization is to enable OPO coordinators to spend enough time with donor families - particularly ensuring that families of color receive the same compassionate time and treatment. Research shows that family decision makers "from regions with the highest authorization rates reported the longest discussions about donation with their respective OPO requesters”[^100] and that “Families who had two-thirds more contact with OPO staff were 3 times as likely to donate irrespective of other factors.”[^101]


### Hiring appropriate OPO staff

Previous drop off points discussed the need for OPOs to hire the appropriate _number_ of OPO staff, but they also need to hire the _right people_ in their staffing. As one OPO leader told us, "_Demographics is important. You have to make sure you're talking the right language and talking to the right people...We consciously did an org chart review and we matched it to our demographics and by zip code, by hospitals, by interactions.”_ Studies have shown that OPO staff is overwhelmingly white and female, which does not accurately represent all the potential donor families the staff is approaching.[^102] “At least one study[^103] has shown family authorization rates for organ donation are higher for African Americans when the OPO staff discussing donation are also African American, but the majority of OPO staff continue to be Caucasian...These results [of lower AA authorization rates] emphasize the critical need for culturally appropriate communication skills to be deployed with African American families throughout the organ donation conversation.”[^104]

Not only race and sex, but language is also a factor to consider for staffing.[^105] Staff should also reflect language demographics of the DSA, given that “avoiding translators during the approach process may improve donation rates.”[^106] We heard of one example of an OPO that had a large Spanish-speaking population in the DSA, yet 9 out of 10 staff members could not speak Spanish. 

One OPO leader told us that not only do OPOs need more diversity in their frontline staff, but also in their leadership. To get to this, diverse staff needs to be developed to take on more leadership roles. _"Leadership and clinical teams at OPOs tend to be overwhelmingly, shockingly White. Black folks donate when the OPO provides optimal care for Black families. And serving communities of color isn’t hiring a single token representative to work in PR or community outreach...it’s growing representation in all ranks of leadership for the communities of color your OPO serves." -Researcher_


### Coordination with hospital staff on approach

Regular coordination between the OPO and hospital staff helps ensure communication and better integration of the ethos of saving as many lives as possible through organ donation. Hospital staff can assist with preparing families for the approach, and may even help with the authorization[^107] if they are involved in the OPO’s planning. One donor hospital physician noted that at a previous hospital she worked at that had a good relationship with their OPO, the OPO staff would always come to the hospital staff first to ask, “when would be a good time and who should we approach?” This would enable the physician to say, “I think they’d be a great candidate, I don’t know where the family’s at but I plan on talking to them in a little bit. If you’re here, I can allow you to come in towards the end of the meeting, etc.”

>"Physicians are trying to keep their patient alive, so sometimes a death is perceived as a failure...How can we make this tragic negative turn into something more positive...have a bit of a silver lining. When we remind them of that, it becomes less of the old mentality that oh, the grim reaper is here, the vultures are here. It’s, these are our partners/trusted colleagues who we know won’t talk with the family until the time is appropriate. Establishing those relationships are absolutely key.” 
>
> __- OPO Coordinator__

---

The responsibility for building relationships and educating donor hospitals often falls exclusively to a “Hospital Development Coordinator,” however, the responsibility should extend to all OPO staff who come onsite at a hospital. A donor family approach should not be the first time the hospital staff meets an OPO coordinator. As an OPO leader told us, high performing OPOs know that _“Organ donation should NOT be transactional. OPOs can’t show up only when there’s a donor. OPOs have to have a relationship [with the donor hospital] BEFORE there’s a donor.” (paraphrased)_ 


### Strong leadership and use of data

Changes in OPO leadership have often resulted in dramatic increases in organ donation rates. “After the Washington OPO hired a new CEO in 2010 and the Oklahoma OPO hired a new CEO in 2012, donors doubled. In 2017, the South Carolina OPO hired a new CEO and saw a 40% increase in donors, and San Francisco, California, increased donors by nearly 30% within 1 year after a new CEO was hired. These numbers far outpace the corresponding overall national increase in donors from the opioid epidemic.”[^108]

 

These leaders have increased donors by focusing on shifting culture within the organizations, using data to better understand community demographics, and aligning all efforts towards procuring and placing organs. One OPO leader said, _“I looked at every area of our organization and how it’s functioning. We were not aligned with our mission: every donor, every time. There were processes and procedures in place that blocked our mission to save every life possible. ”_

One example of building culture to improve organ recovery we heard was, _"The family authorization piece is the number one thing we focused on. We had a system where we would actually notify all the staff that we had a family authorization pending...So even if you're in accounting, you know that someone's down in the hospital talking to a family. We wanted this to be in their DNA. This is what we do. This is the moment. The person talking to family knows that everyone's supporting them at the home office and we're all in this together...We saw our family authorizations go through the roof."_

    Donation can occur after brain death (DBD) or after circulatory death (DCD).

[^12]:
    "For potential brain dead donors, the data indicates that best practices are to introduce the possibility of brain death as early as possible, specifically once the injury or the condition indicates it is not survivable. This is likely when the brain death protocol is started or when the family or health care providers begin discussing withdrawal of mechanical supports. For patients who are potentially eligible for DCD, it is when the family initiates a discussion of withdrawal of supports." - Researcher

    One OPO using the fully-automated referral system estimated a 5%-10% increase in referrals.

[^30]:
    An electronic referral should make it easy for an Intensive Care Unit clinician to click a single button in the electronic medical record when a patient is at end of life, to both notify the OPTN database directly and copy its local OPO that a potential donor should be evaluated by the OPO. It is important to stress the need for good user experience design to reduce, not add, burden on referral from the hospital staff. Electronic referral would have the added benefit of reducing time and transcription errors in organ procurement for the OPO. Staff from OPOs would also benefit from this feature, so they do not have to use tertiary systems, where manual data entry leads to the opportunity to lose or mistype data.

    "Whether it's [a referral is] imminent, eligible, or neither can change throughout the process, depending on when you close a referral out. That's how OPOs have a way to manipulate that metric. So, if there is a 74-year old that hasn't been declared brain dead, but we think the patient is brain dead, and the physician says they're not going to do brain death testing unless the family is interested in donation. Well, that patient is not eligible until that brain death testing occurs. So, you can have a conversation about donation and the family says they're not interested. Then the brain death testing never occurs to make the patient eligible, so they get dispositioned as a neither. If testing does occur, you get put in a position where you have to get authorization or your conversion rate is damaged." - OPO CEO

    "You can flatly approach someone, and they will flatly say no. Or you can empower and inspire them. It’s a science, you have to study, you have to be prepared, you have to know your audience. It’s all about the approach. All of our approaches, as much as possible, should be planned. That’s why I have authorization coaches who can help identify things that could thwart the ‘yes.’ Buddhist people have different things that they want done, but will still donate. Muslim families will donate, but they need certain things done within 24 hours. This is our job to know these things. The things that I’m doing are not rocket science. I’m just being sensitive to people’s needs. It's being inclusive. People say 'whoa, what are you doing to get those results?' And I laugh and I say, it’s just responding to people’s needs. It’s hard work, but it’s completely doable. I don’t want people to think I’m doing something no one else can do. I’m not. It’s just customer service. But a lot of OPOs wouldn’t do that.

    A researcher noted, “The best way to do this, however, is to start the discussion early, before the formal declaration of death is made. The OPO or hospital staff will often tell the family that the patient is dead, and then 2 minutes later ask about donation. They think this is separating the request from the declaration of death. The better way to do it is to not see the 'request' as a single event but as a conversation that starts when there's a real possibility that the patient will not survive and is or will probably become brain dead."

The OPO must maintain data in a format that can readily be transferred to a successor OPO and in the event of a transfer must provide to CMS copies of all records, data, and software necessary to ensure uninterrupted service by a successor OPO. Records and data subject to this requirement include donor and transplant beneficiary records and procedural manuals and other materials used in conducting OPO operations.

    Current regulation language § 486.342 (a) An OPO must have a written protocol to ensure that, in the absence of a donor document, the individual(s) responsible for making the donation decision are informed of their options to donate organs or tissues (when the OPO is making a request for tissues) or to decline to donate. **The OPO must provide to the individual(s) responsible for making the donation decision, at a minimum, the following: **(1) A list of the organs and/or tissues that may be recovered. (2) The most likely uses for the donated organs or tissues. (3) A description of the screening and recovery processes. (4) Information about the organizations that will recover, process, and distribute the tissue. (5) Information regarding access to and release of the donor's medical records. (6) An explanation of the impact the donation process will have on burial arrangements and the appearance of the donor's body.

    Current regulation language § 486.344 (a) Potential donor protocol management. (2) The OPO must implement a system that ensures that a qualified physician or other qualified individual is available to assist in the medical management of a potential donor when the surgeon on call is unavailable.

[^153]:
    Current regulation language § 486.344 (c) _Testing._ The OPO must do the following: (2) Ensure that screening and testing of the potential donor (including point-of-care testing and blood typing) are conducted by a laboratory that is certified in the appropriate specialty or subspecialty of service in accordance with part 493 of this chapter. (3) Ensure that the potential donor's blood is typed using two separate blood samples.

    Inclusion of this information provides more timely and complete options for the family about end of life decisions. Hospitals interpret the intent of this regulation to preclude a pre-withdrawal DCD discussion mention. Inadequate time to consider/pursue DCD is often cited as the reason for declination.

    Current regulation language § 486.346 (c) The OPO must develop and follow a written protocol for packaging, labeling, handling, and shipping organs in a manner that ensures their arrival without compromise to the quality of the organ. The protocol must include procedures to check the accuracy and integrity of labels, packaging, and contents prior to transport, including verification by two individuals, one of whom must be an OPO employee, that information listed on the labels is correct.

[^159]:
    Current regulation language § 486.348 (a) Standard: Components of a QAPI program. The OPO's QAPI program must include objective measures to evaluate and demonstrate improved performance with regard to OPO activities, such as hospital development, designated requestor training, donor management, timeliness of on-site response to hospital referrals, consent practices, organ recovery and placement, and organ packaging and transport. The OPO must take actions that result in performance improvements and track performance to ensure that improvements are sustained.

[^160]:
    Topics of high value include research to improve OPO practices in deceased donor evaluation, family authorization approach, deceased donor management, and organ recovery. (1) Priority should be given to evaluating and improving OPO practice among historically under-recovered and marginalized groups, such as racial/ethnic minority patients, rural patients, older patients, single organ donors, HIV-positive patients, and decedents evaluated for DCD donation. (2) Evaluation and improvement measures for organ donation must include a requirement for both ongoing scheduled review of actual performance in context with objectively determined donation potential. Local donation performance must be considered with regard to both trajectory compared to prior periods and relative performance compared to other areas of the country. (3) In addition to regular data-driven analysis of performance, further research is needed to determine the role of specific practices and processes in both high- and low-performing areas. (4) These analyses should include data from hospital and OPO stakeholders of sufficient detail to identify root causes of missed opportunities and systemic patterns of resource allocation. (5) The architecture of OPO performance data must be designed to facilitate third party review of practice and process data. Academic institutions and researchers with an interest in transplant and quality improvement must be granted access to all mandated data, including data reported that could be used for performance assessment of federal transplant contractors including the OPTN and SRTR.

    "_Almost all are imports now. It's really become expensive_" said one intake coordinator for a transplant center. Another surgeon told us that organ transplant cost had increased by a million dollars due to additional “processing fees,” and that “that additional million is going to the OPO’s.”
